## Overview

### What is Document Understanding Evaluation Template?

This template project facilitates the efficient development of workflows that output information about the extraction accuracy of Document Understanding in a beautiful Excel format automatically.

### Features

Minimum Effort Development::

You can just focus on… 
- Taxonomy definition
- Classification/Extraction logic

+
You do not even need to add any additional activities, valuables and arguments!

Faster Validation Flow::
Since Validation Actions will be uploaded in bulk, the lead time can be shortened because the “Extraction by Robots” and “Validation by human" can be processed in parallel for multiple documents.

Multiple OCRs Evaluation::
By enabling specific OCRs in Config.xlsx, you can apply multiple OCRs to the DU and create evaluation reports for each OCR simultaneously.

### Use cases

DU accuracy reporting::
Rendering the extraction accuracy of a DU for given documents in a beautiful Excel format automatically to assist in evaluating the functionality of the DU

OCR Comparison::
Comparing the extraction accuracy of each OCR applied to DU

Improve DU accuracy::
Optimizing the development process to improve DU's document extraction accuracy based on the benchmarks

Action Center Demo::
Demonstration for building Document Validation Actions in the Action Center

## Quick Start Guide

After creating a new project from the Document Understanding Evaluation Template, you can accomplish the goal with a minimum of effort by following the steps described below.

### Preparation Steps

. Place `Document.Understanding.Evaluation.Template.X.X.X.nupkg` in the template folder (https://github.com/masaki-kumamoto/DocumentUnderstandingEvaluationTemplate/packages/828024[Download Document.Understanding.Evaluation.Template Nupkg from here])
- You can identify the template folder below.
+
```
UiPath Studio > Settings > Locations > Publish project templates URL
e.g. “C:\Users\masaki.kumamoto\Documents\UiPath\.templates”
```

. Create a new project from the template
+
```
UiPath Studio > Templates > Document Understanding Evaluation Template
```

. Wait until the project will resolve the dependency
- If Studio can’t auto-resolve the dependency for `Microsoft.Office.interop.Excel`, enable nuget.org (https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json) as a package source in package manager and install the package.


### Development Steps

. Place target documents in Input folder +
- If you use Form Extractor/Intelligent Form Extractor, you can also place template documents in "TemplateDocument" Folder).
- The file name placed in the Input Folder should not exceed 31 characters including the file extension. If the number of characters exceeds 31, an error will occur when creating the sheet in the Report Excel file.

. Configure `Config.xlsx`
- "DUSettings" Sheet::
** DU_ApiKey
** DU_DocumentTypeId +
(If you use Classification activity, you do NOT need to specify this field. You can find the value in Taxonomy Manager once you create a taxonom in step 3.)

- "ActionSettings" Sheet
** AC_AssignUserEmail
** OC_FolderPath
+
Orchestrator Folder name that your Studio/Robot is deployed in
** SB_BacketName
+
Set the same name Storage Bucket in Orchestrator

- "OcrSettings" Sheet
** Set TRUE for the OCR to be applied to DU. You can enable multiple OCRs to be applied.  +
(UiPath Document Understanding OCR will always be performed)

. Define Taxonomy
- Set the definition of the field information to be extracted from Ribbon>Design>Taxonomy Manager. +
(https://docs.uipath.com/document-understanding/docs/taxonomy-manager#using-taxonomy-manager[How to use Taxonomy Manager ])

. Build `DU_GetExtractionResult.xaml`
- If you want to use Classification, Enable “Classification + Extraction” sequence +
If not, Enable “Extraction Only” sequence
- Delete Classification/Extraction Activities which you do not use
- For more information on how to develop DU Classification/Extraction, you can refer to the following links.

### Execution Steps

. Run `01_ExtractDocumentsData.xaml`
- You should stop the OneDrive sync function while the process is running otherwise an error may occur. 
- It takes about 1-2 minutes to process each document. +
(It would take more with “Debug” so “Run” is recommended)
- After the execution is complete, Excel reports for each OCR set in Config.xlsx and the Document Validation Action in Action Center will be generated.

. Complete the Document Validation Action task in Action Center

. Run `02_CopyActualValuesToReport.xaml`

- Immediately after the execution, the robot will prompt the user to select a folder where the DU evaluation reports are located.
- After the execution is completed, the results of the Document Validation Actions will be pasted to the `ActionList.xlsx` and the `DU Evaluation Reports` for each OCR.
- If there are documents that have not yet been validated by Document Validation Actions when Step 3 is completed, complete the validation in Validation Action and then execute Step 3 again to complete DU evaluation reports.


### Improvement Steps

Use existing ActionList.xlsx to improve the DU logic::
If you have performed the "Execution Steps" and generated ActionList.xlsx for the same list of documents using the same taxonomy in the past, from next time, you can skip step 2 & 3 by following the steps below.
You can also disable to create Document Validation Action so the process can run faster.
+
This capability is useful to modify the workflow based on the accuracy rate from previous execution result report, so you can improve the DU’s classification/extraction logic.
+
- Configure `Config.xlsx`
** "BasicSettings" Sheet
*** AL_UseExistingActionListExcel (= TRUE)
*** AL_ExistingActionListExcelPath
** "ActionSettings" Sheet
*** AC_DocumentValidationAction_Use (= False)

## Other useful features

### Multi OCR execution

By enabling specific OCRs in Config.xlsx, you can apply multiple OCRs to the DU and create evaluation reports for each OCR simultaneously. (UiPath Document OCR will be always used)

e.g. Use "TesseractOCR" and "OmniPageOCR" ::
+
[caption="Config.xlsx"]
.(OcrSettings sheet)
[cols="1h,4"]
|===
|Header name |Description

|OCR_TesseractOCR_Use
|TRUE

|OCR_TesseractOCR_Language
|eng

|OCR_OmniPageOCR_Use
|TRUE

|OCR_OmniPageOCR_Language
|eng

|===

### Auto verification confidence threshold

You can use extraction Confidence and OcrOonfidence as a threshold for auto verification. +
If both of them are above or equal to thresholds, the fields will be automatically verified by Robots.

e.g. Confidence Threshold = 99.98%, OcrConfidence Threshold = 95.99%::
+
[caption="Config.xlsx"]
.(OcrSettings sheet)
[cols="1h,4"]
|===
|Header name |Description

|DU_AutoVerifyMinimumThreshold_Confidence
|99.98%

|DU_AutoVerifyMinimumThreshold_OcrConfidence
|95.99%

|===

### Show OcrConfidence in validation action

You can select Confidence or OcrConfidence as the value to be displayed in the Action Center. +
Depends on the documents set you deal with, chose the proper one.

e.g. Show OcrConfidence in Document Validation Actions instead of Confidence::
+
[caption="Config.xlsx"]
.(DuSettings sheet)
[cols="1h,4"]
|===
|Header name |Description

|DU_ValidationConfidenceType
|OcrConfidence

|===

### Use existing Action.xlsx as an actual value reference

If you have performed the "Execution Steps" and generated ActionList.xlsx for the same list of documents using the same taxonomy in the past, from next time, you can skip step validation in Action Center and execution of 02_CopyActualValuesToReport.xaml.

e.g. Use existing Action.xlsx(Output/20210601/ActionList.xlsx) as an actual value reference::
+
[caption="Config.xlsx"]
.(DuSettings sheet)
[cols="1h,4"]
|===
|Header name |Description

|AL_UseExistingActionListExcel 
|TRUE

|AL_ExistingActionListExcelPath
|Output/20210601/ActionList.xlsx
